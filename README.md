# flask-login
### This is a simple project to demonstrate the basic skeleton of what a Flask project could look like.

The repository contains two main files
1. login-operations.py: 
Think of this as the backend of the project. This contains a class that implements the database functionalities.
Ignore the main function here, that is only required when running the program from the CLI.

2. main-ui.py:
Think of this as the frontend of the project. 
This contains an object of the class created in the backend. Database interactions take place through that object.
This file also contains functions that render HTML in the webpage.
